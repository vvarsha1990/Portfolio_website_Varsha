          <h2> My Story </h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><br>I am Varsha. I am currently working on my certification at CareerFoundry for User Experience. As a designer, I love to work on a project completely from the very beginning of the cycle through the ideation process then the designing, testing, implementing and managing the same. I always strive to bridge the gap between people and technology by transforming problems into elegant solutions. I Strongly believe that one can design well only when you understand your users well.</p>
          <p>My bachelors is in Bio medicine and I specialised in Clinical research and data management. I worked in the field of clinical research as an analyst and coordinator. </p>
          <p>I relate UX to being very similar to clinical research in many ways. In both we find out what the people want, research what is already there in the market, what kind of problems are faced by the people and you for solutions, design something to try and solve that problem, test it in the real world to see if it worked and then finally release it out to the people. This similarity is what led me to like UX and wanting to be a UX designer. </p>
          <p>In my personal time you will find me painting while having a good cup of coffee (which I'm addicted to). When it comes to fitness I challenge myself every time to be the better version of myself. Fun fact is that I learnt and got into weight lifting during my pregnancy. I love DIY projects and I am always finding inspirations to decorate every nook and corner of my house. Cooking has become a new passion now and so experimenting a lot of vegetarian dishes has become a good time pass. I am currently based in Austin, Texas and I hail from the cultural capital, India.</p>
