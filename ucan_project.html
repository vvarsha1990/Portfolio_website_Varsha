        <h2> THE PROCESS </h2>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p> The entire process for developing my app can be shown in a 6 part course.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The RESEARCH phase involves in identifying the problems that users face and proposing a solution as to how that can be solved. Then comes the competitive analysis to check out the market of how the fitness apps are working and how they have overcome many different problems, which then leads to user surveys and interviews to better understand the user’s point of view.</li>
          <li>The DEFINE phase is where user personas and journey maps are created by analysing the problems from user interviews. Site maps are designed which help in providing a bird’s eye view of what the app consists of.</li>
          <li>The IDEATE phase is a highlight to information architecture where the user flows are created with the help of sitemap and card sorting. This leads to designing a visual mockup of the app by sketching and creating wireframes.</li>
        </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>The PROTOTYPE phase is where the wireframes are turned into prototypes of 3 different levels:</li>
        <li> The low fidelity prototype which involves sketching the base architecture of the app.</li>
<li>The mid fidelity prototype which involves converting the low fidelity design to simple mockups.</li>
<li>The high fidelity prototype which involves designing how the app will actually look.</li>

          <li>In the TEST phase, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) which was created in the high fidelity prototype is tested by conducting usability tests and major errors such as design errors, navigation errors, user flow errors are discovered and corrected.</li>
          <li>The PROTOTYPE and TEST phase keeps on continuing on a loop until the design is on a more usable scale.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2> THE RESEARCH PHASE </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>To better understand the market and the current landscape I did a competitive analysis. Conducting the competitive analysis gave me an insight as to what features the apps offer for the users and what their strengths and weaknesses are. It also provided a way to check out the various design elements in different apps and what the market had to offer.</p>

        <h2> UNDERSTANDING THE USERS </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p> 3 user Interviews were performed and I wanted to gain a perspective similar to the target users, so the most important task here was to try and bring out most of the characteristics of the target users into the 3 personas. Creating the 3 personas helped me in the deep understanding of user behavior and needs which makes it possible to define who a product is being created for and what is necessary or unnecessary for them from a user-centered point of view.</p>

      <div>
        <h2> IDEATION </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p> I first created the initial version of the site map which served as a visual mockup of my app. With this initial version I conducted an open card sorting exercise with 6 participants. Using the insights from the card sorting exercise I created a second version of the site map with variations according to the results from the card sort. This provided me with the pathway of the navigation that each user might take to help achieve their end task easily.</p>

        <h2> WIREFRAMES </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Based on the user flow and the information architecture and site map I started sketching roughly the main features of the app. This created an idea of what the app design and functionality must look like.</p>

        <h2> DESIGN </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>For designing my app I learned some of the best practices involved in the designing process like A/B preference testing, designing using the Gestalt’s principles and implementing iOS human interface guidelines. The designing of my app has gone through many revisions and testing. Each test revealed a few changes and improvements that could be done and the iterations have gone through many versions.</p>

        <h2> PROTOTYPE </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The mid fidelity prototype is suited for the validation of the interaction concept. In contrast to a paper prototype the understandability of interaction elements can be validated. The mid fidelity prototype For every action step, I created a basic visual design. The main design layout was taken in from the sketches that I drew in the low fidelity wireframes. This gives more accurate depictions of the layout, and detail around how things will work.</p>

          <h2> LEARNINGS AND TAKEAWAYS </h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>The Project itself was a great opportunity for me to help understand the process that goes into designing an app. Each step of the process challenged me to devise interesting and new design elements, and the project as a whole gave me a new understanding of the importance of good design. Through this project I learnt the ins-and-outs of design software, how to gain insight from research, create tests and interviews to verify the validity of my designs, and follow an iterative process to create the best design I possibly could. I also learnt how to understand the user’s point of view and design the app according to their needs and insights.</p>
